                    In 2005, the Blair-led Labour party won more than half the seats in the House of Commons, with just
                    the support of a little over a third of the voters. Two-thirds of all votes were cast against the
                    government but they still won.

                    In the 2010 General Election, the Liberal Democrats got about a quarter of the vote, but less than
                    10% of seats in the House of Commons. In the same election the Greens got only one seat in Parliament,
                    while UKIP voters were completely unrepresented.
                </div>
                <p>The election system in the UK, known as First Past the Post, disproportionately gives the top two
                political parties more seats in Parliament than they deserve at the expense of smaller parties.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MPs who despite most of their constituents voting against them.</li>
                    <li>Governments elected with most voters voting against them.</li>
                    <li>A 2 party solution with no room for any more parties.</li>
                    <li>An ever more "elite" group of politicians who do not feel accountable to their voters.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All this then leads to scandalous politicians who are able to act with impunity in their elite circles.
                Career politicians are one example of a consequence of this system, where politicians do not need to worry
                about their electorate removing them.</p>

                <h2>The alternative: Proportional Representation</h2>
                <p>The most logical way for us to fix this is to simply have an election system where the percentage of
                the vote a political party gets is related to the percentage of seats they get in Parliament.</p>
                <p>This is known as Proportional Representation, it is already used in the overwhelming majority of other
                    European countries as well as ones in the Commonwealth. Not only that, but it is considerably highly used
                in Britain.</p>

                <p>Cases where a Proportional Election system is used in the United Kingdom:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Local elections in Scotland and Northern Ireland</li>
                    <li>The London Assembly</li>
                    <li>The Scottish Parliament</li>
                    <li>The Welsh Assembley</li>
                    <li>The Northern Irish Assembly</li>
                    <li>National European elections</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In 2011, in the second ever nationwide referendum, the British people rejected a change to the electoral
                system which would ensure an MP must have over 50% of the vote in their area. This was not a proportional
                system, only a proportional election system would ensure the percentage of vote a party recieves represents
                how many seats they get in Parliament. Opinion polls show a majority of the British public support a
                proportional electoral system.</p>
